## Overview
8 Ball pool is a game played with a total of sixteen balls (one of which is the cue ball, the only ball that can be hit by players) and six holes (known as pockets) on a rectangular table. During the game, two players take turns hitting the cue ball with a stick (the cue). The aim of both players is to sink all of their balls (either striped or solid) into a hole, by utilizing the collisions between the balls. This simulation attempts to model the collisions between pool balls on a pool table using the principles of friction, conservation of momentum, and conservation of energy (where collisions between the balls are assumed to be perfectly elastic). The simulation includes the ability to place balls on the table, aim the cue ball, and adjust the strength of the shot (using a strength slider bar).

## Instructions
1. Click within the table to add new balls.

2. Drag the mouse to angle the cue ball.

3. Slide the mouse along the power bar (to the right of the table) to adjust the strength of the shot.

4. Press enter to fire the ball and watch the collisions.

5. Once all of the balls have stopped, you will be able to aim the cue ball again!

PS: Press 1 to see a pre-designed template that sets up an easy endgame, and lose the game by shooting the ball in. Press 3 to return to the normal game. Press 3 to restart the game after someone wins!
