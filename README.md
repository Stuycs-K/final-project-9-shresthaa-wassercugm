## Overview
8 Ball pool is a game played with a total of sixteen balls (one of which is the cue ball, the only ball that can be hit by players) and six holes (known as pockets) on a rectangular table. During the game, two players take turns hitting the cue ball with a stick (the cue). The aim of both players is to sink all of their balls (either striped or solid) into a hole, by utilizing the collisions between the balls. The black 8 ball should be pocketed last, or else the game is lost. In order to create an accurate simulation, our game takes into account friction between the balls and the table and collisions between the balls using conservation of momentum and energy (collisions are assumed to be perfectly elastic). Players can control the direction and shot strength of the cue ball.

## Instructions

1. Drag the mouse to angle the cue ball.

2. Slide the mouse along the power bar (to the right of the table) to adjust the strength of the shot.

3. Press enter to fire the ball and watch the collisions (The score tracker on the bottom indicates which balls are still on the board).

4. Once all of the balls have stopped, you will be able to aim the cue ball again. The text on the bottom left corner indicates which player's turn it is.

5. Try to demolish your friends (if you have any) by pocketing all of your balls and then the 8 ball.

To see predesigned templates, press:

1. Normal 8-ball game

2. Winning endgame (player has pocketed all of their balls): simply shoot the 8 ball to win.

3. Losing endgame (player still has some balls remaining): shoot the 8 ball and see the other player win.

4. Restart the game after winning

PS: An easy cheat for aiming is to hold down the 0 button. While holding down the button, you can click anywhere on the board and place the cue ball there.
