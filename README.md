## Overview
8 Ball pool is a game played with sixteen balls on a table with six holes (pockets). During the game, two players take turns hitting one of the balls (the solid white cue ball) with a stick. The goal of the game is to sink all of you balls into the hole, utilizing the collisions between the balls to do so. This simulation attempts to model the collisions between pool balls on a pool table, using the principles of friction, conservation of momentum, and conservation of energy (the collisions between the balls are assumed to be perfectly elastic). The simulation includes the ability to place balls on the table, aim the cue ball, and adjust the strength of the shot.

## Instructions
Click to add new balls

Drag the mouse on the pool table to aim the cue ball

Drag the mouse along the power bar on the right to adjust the strength of the shot

Press enter to fire

Once all of the balls are at rest, you will be able to aim the cue ball again!

Press 1 to see a pre-designed template that sets up a standard break shot
